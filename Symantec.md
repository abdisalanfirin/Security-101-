# Part I: Symantec
For Part 1 of your homework assignment, you should primarily use the Symantec Internet Security Threat Report along with independent research to answer the following questions.

### Question 1
What is formjacking?
### Answer 1
Incidents of formjacking—the use of malicious JavaScript code to steal credit card details and other information from payment forms on the checkout web pages of eCommerce sites—trended upwards in 2018

### Question 2
How many websites are compromised each month with formjacking code? 
### Answer 2
Symantec data shows that 4,818 unique websites were compromised with formjacking code every month in 2018

### Answer 11
The exploit kit gathers information on the victim machine, finds vulnerabilities and determines the appropriate exploit.

### Question 12
What does the criminal group SamSam specialize in? 
### Answer 12
targeted ransomware attacks, breaking into networks and encrypting multiple computers across an organization before issuing a high-value ransom demand. 

### Question 13
How many SamSam attacks did Symantec find evidence of in 2018? 
### Answer 13
During 2018, Symantec found evidence of 67 SamSam attacks, mostly against organizations in the U.S. 

### Question 14
Even though ransomware attacks declined in 2017-2018, what was one dramatic change that occurred? 
### Answer 14
Up until 2017, consumers were the hardest hit by ransomware, accounting for the majority of infections.
In 2017, the balance tipped towards enterprises, with the majority of infections occurring in businesses.
In 2018, that shift accelerated and enterprises accounted for 81 percent of all ransomware infections. While overall ransomware infections were down, enterprise infections were up by 12 percent in 2018.

### Question 15
In 2018, what was the primary ransomware distribution method? 
### Answer 15
Email campaigns that use spear phishing.

### Question 16
What operating systems do most types of ransomware attacks still target?
### Answer 16
Eighty-five percent of managed service providers (MSPs) say the Windows OS is targeted most frequently by ransomware attacks

### Question 17
What are “living off the land” attacks? What is the advantage to hackers? 
### Answer 17
These are attacks in which hackers use tools that are already installed on the victim’s computers, instead of using other outside tools.
By using these native tools, hackers can more easily hide their activity amidst the legitimate processes occurring on a victim’s computer. And even if the malicious activity is identified, it is harder to attribute and identify the specific attacks and attackers.

### Question 18
What is an example of a tool that’s used in “living off the land” attacks?
### Answer 18
The most frequently executed tools observed by Symantec in Q1 2019 were net.exe, PowerShell, the certification utility, the task scheduler, and the WMI command line (WMIC).

### Question 19
What are zero-day exploits?
### Answer 19
is the loose term for a recently discovered vulnerability or exploit for a vulnerability that hackers can use to attack systems

### Question 20
By what percentage did zero-day exploits decline in 2018? 
### Answer 20
Only 23 percent of attack groups were known to use zero days, down from 27 percent in 2017

### Question 21
What are two techniques that worms such as Emotet and Qakbot use?
### Answer 21
Qakbot, a family of banking Trojans known for behaving like network worms. Like Emotet, Qakbot can self-propagate. Qakbot attempts brute force access to spread across networks and also uses “living-off-the-land” tools to propagate. It uses PowerShell to download 

### Question 22
What are supply chain attacks? By how much did they increase in 2018?
### Answer 22
Supply chain attacks, which use loopholes in third-party services to strike a target, increased 78 percent between 2017 and 2018, and web attacks, which rely on malicious URLs and other online weapons, also spiked 78 percent.

### Question 23
What challenge do supply chain attacks and living off the land attacks highlight for organizations? 
### Answer 23
Both supply chain and living-off-the-land attacks highlight the challenges facing organizations and individuals, with attacks increasingly arriving through trusted channels, using fileless attack methods or legitimate tools for malicious purposes.

### Question 24
The 20 most active groups tracked by Symantec targeted an average of how many organizations between 2016 and 2018? 
### Answer 24
The 20 most active groups tracked by Symantec targeted an average of 55 organizations over the past three years, up from 42 between 2015 and 2017

### Question 25
How many individuals or organizations were indicted for cyber criminal activities in 2018? What are some of the countries that these entities were from? 
### Answer 25
49 organizations and some of the countries are russia china iran and north korea

### Question 26
When it comes to the increased number of cloud cybersecurity attacks, what is the common theme? 
### Answer 26
They have poor configurations 

### Question 27
What is the implication for successful cloud exploitation that provides access to memory locations that are normally forbidden? 
### Answer 27
Hardware chips. 
This is particularly problematic for cloud services because, while cloud instances have their own virtual processors, they share pools of memory. Therefore, a successful attack on a single physical system could result in data being leaked from several cloud instances.

### Question 28
What are two examples of the above cloud attack? 
### Answer 28
Meltdown attack and specteri attack 

### Question 29
Regarding Internet of Things (IoT) attacks, what were the two most common infected devices and what percentage of IoT attacks were attributed to them? 
### Answer 29
Routers and cameras

### Question 30
What is the Mirai worm and what does it do? 
### Answer 30
Mirai is malware that infects smart devices that run on ARC processors, turning them into a network of remotely controlled bots or "zombies". This network of bots, called a botnet, is often used to launch DDoS attacks.

### Question 31
Why was Mirai the third most common IoT threat in 2018? 
### Answer 31
Mirai is constantly evolving and variants use up to 16 different exploits, persistently adding new exploits to increase the success rate for infection, as devices often remain unpatched. The worm also expanded its target scope by going after unpatched Linux servers.

### Question 32
What was unique about VPNFilter with regards to IoT threats?
### Answer 32
VPNFilter was the first widespread persistent IoT threat, with its ability to survive a reboot making it very difficult to remove. With an array of potent payloads at its disposal, such as man in the middle (MitM) attacks, data exfiltration, credential theft, and interception of SCADA communications, VPNFilter was a departure from traditional IoT threat activity such as DDoS and coin mining. It also includes a destructive capability which can “brick,” or wipe a device at the attackers’ command, should they wish to destroy evidence.
